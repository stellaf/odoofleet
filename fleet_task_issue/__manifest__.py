=============================
This module link the fleet and project with one analytic account. 
when you create one vehicle
-------------
		* This works for the fleet that has not created an analytic account yet. One project with the same vehicle name will be created under the project menu.
		* thus you can schedule the task and issues for this vehicle.
		* smart buttons to this vehicles task and issues are added to each vehicle's form.
		* menu for task and issues are added to fleet_vehicle menu to view all vehicles task and issue.
		* In order to separate the vehicle type project from normal project, you may use 
		* two apps, "project category", "task type color".
